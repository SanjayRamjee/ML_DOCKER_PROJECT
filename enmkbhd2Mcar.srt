1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,200
So in a world of electric cars, in this

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,780
video, we're gonna be taking a look at a

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:11,320
$20,000 hybrid, $120,000 hybrid, and a $2

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,740
million hybrid car. So this video is part

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,800
an explainer, part a chance to drive some

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,640
really sick cars. Shout out to Triple F

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,500
Collection. We'll get there. Anyway,

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,840
unless you guys have been living under a

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,540
rock, you've seen that electric cars have

10
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,940
been having a bit of a renaissance

11
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,160
lately, surging in popularity, till the

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,980
number 1 best sold new car on Earth is

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,380
electric. But, they are still very much a

14
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,400
new technology. Like they're obviously

15
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,940
awesome with instant torque and no

16
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,800
emissions and fast acceleration, but they

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,940
have these huge heavy batteries and they

18
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,720
take forever to recharge and there's not

19
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,240
enough infrastructure for everyone to own

20
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,360
them. So there's this window now where it

21
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,200
makes a lot of sense that maybe for most

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,720
people a hybrid is actually the best

23
00:00:51,720 --> 00:01:12,040
option. Interesting. So I don't think

24
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,360
anyone's buying the Corolla for speed or

25
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,020
power. I mean, if I'm being honest, it's

26
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,900
actually still pretty zippy. So this car

27
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,580
starts at $24,000 and it's a hybrid

28
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,380
purely, purely for efficiency. So the

29
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,180
basics of this hybrid system, and many

30
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,060
others in the same class, is that the

31
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,820
wheels can be driven by the gas engine or

32
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,420
the electric motor or both. So this

33
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,100
Corolla Hybrid has a 1.8 liter engine and

34
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,280
1 electric motor at the front axle that

35
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,440
deliver a combined 138 horsepower. And

36
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,440
it's powering the electric motor with a

37
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,260
pretty small 1.6 kilowatt hour battery.

38
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,020
So at low speeds, you've probably been in

39
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,720
a car like this, the car goes totally

40
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,280
electric, the gas engine turns off, but

41
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,340
once you go over a certain speed or use a

42
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,660
certain amount of power, then it's going

43
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,480
to fire up the gas engine again and it

44
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,300
couples it with the electric motor. Then

45
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,200
anytime you're braking or coasting,

46
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,400
that's when it charges the battery back

47
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,240
up. It's as you're slowing down, it

48
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,200
captures some of that energy. So it never

49
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,280
actually needs to be plugged in to charge

50
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,600
up that small battery. And this system is

51
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,320
good for literally 50 miles per gallon.

52
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,920
When you drive this car, you literally

53
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,000
have a game score, an eco score as you

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,520
drive of, if you can slow down and roll

55
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,660
onto your accelerations better and roll

56
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,320
to a stop more easily, you can gamify

57
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,400
efficiency in this car to get your

58
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,460
maximum miles per gallon. So it actually

59
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,720
divides it up. I have my eco zone, so I'm

60
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,640
driving and if I get my little bar in the

61
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,720
eco zone, I'm doing a good job. And then

62
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,920
I have starts, cruises and stops. I've

63
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,960
gotten my eco score pretty high not to

64
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,760
brag, but I've seen it in the 70s, which

65
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,020
is pretty sick I don't know what happens

66
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,660
when I get to a hundred But what I do

67
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,000
know is the better I get that score the

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,600
more miles per gallon I get But yeah,

69
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,940
pretty much everything about the rest of

70
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,800
this car is designed around that

71
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,080
efficiency. It's aerodynamic enough that

72
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,320
it slips through the air. It's got tires

73
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,240
that have a low rolling resistance. It

74
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,000
doesn't have these like sticky grippy

75
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,600
tires. That's what that's actually

76
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,520
against efficiency in this case. So if

77
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,020
you're looking for a reason why someone

78
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,280
would buy a hybrid today, it's because

79
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,580
they're not trying to charge a huge

80
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,580
battery every night in their garage or

81
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,320
rely on the grid or rely on finding

82
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,200
public chargers. It's because they just

83
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,180
want better gas mileage and they want to

84
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,440
spend less, not 0, but less on gas today.

85
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,500
But you already know, these cars are

86
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,220
obviously very utility focused. They're

87
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,780
for people who just are going places,

88
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,680
right? But what if you're more after the

89
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,280
ultimate driving machine, something a

90
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,260
little more versatile, then you can spend

91
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,340
a little more money and get something

92
00:03:50,460 --> 00:04:01,460
like this. All right, so this car starts

93
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,740
at about $100,000 a little over, and this

94
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,040
car is a hybrid for versatility. So the

95
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,540
idea is this is a BMW 750E. There's a

96
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,160
bunch of vehicles in this class, but

97
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,800
yeah, you've spent enough money now at

98
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,980
this point that you can reap the benefits

99
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,260
of both gas and electric. So this hybrid

100
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,100
system has a bit more hardware to

101
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,320
accomplish 2 different goals. So there's

102
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,440
a 3 liter straight 6 engine making around

103
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,960
300 horsepower and a medium sized 14.4

104
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,920
kilowatt hour larger battery powering a

105
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,400
roughly 200 horsepower electric motor. So

106
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,220
you're totaling around 500 horsepower. So

107
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,080
once again, it can drive using both gas

108
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,820
and electric, just like the Toyota. But

109
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,060
now there's enough battery capacity that

110
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,460
you can also drive fully electric at

111
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,940
Totally normal everyday driving speeds up

112
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,720
to like 30 miles on a charge without ever

113
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,740
turning on the gas engine and then also

114
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,720
Unlike the Corolla This is a plug-in

115
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,640
hybrid so you can directly plug the car

116
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,000
into a wall to replenish the battery and

117
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,160
just keep driving around on electric as

118
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,800
long as You want to with 0 gas use so it

119
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,580
does everything in the Toyota does but

120
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,600
more I do feel like plug-in hybrids at

121
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,300
this moment in time are the 1 that make

122
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,220
the most sense for the most people that I

123
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,160
see driving them. Because if you have a

124
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,760
short commute, let's say you have a 10

125
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,440
mile commute every day, and you just plug

126
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,420
in at a charger at work or in your garage

127
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,480
every night or during work in the

128
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,080
daytime, You can just straight up never

129
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,200
pay for gas again and drive it just like

130
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,420
an electric car But on the off chance you

131
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,440
do need to drive further go for a road

132
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,480
trip Or just do something more than your

133
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,540
normal 10 mile commute you have all the

134
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,920
benefits of a gas car Thankfully these

135
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,640
hybrids also have 1 crucial piece of the

136
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,900
electric car, which is regenerative

137
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,660
braking, which means it's going to be

138
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,300
able to recuperate a lot of the energy

139
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,480
once I've gotten up to speed and start

140
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,840
filling up the battery as I'm driving. So

141
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,760
there's a little graph on the dash you

142
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,140
can see here, which means as I accelerate

143
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,880
and I take energy out of the battery it

144
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,880
goes up but as I decelerate it's actually

145
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,800
blending and friction braking with

146
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,600
regenerative braking and if I drive

147
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,040
around like this long enough especially

148
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,220
if I go down hills and brake a lot I will

149
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,720
actually start adding to the charge of

150
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,340
this battery too. But you know how

151
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,500
electric cars also have that party trick

152
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,720
of instant torque available at any RPM

153
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,840
and any speed? Well, the hybrid should

154
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,780
benefit a little bit from that too. So

155
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,660
because this motor is powerful enough and

156
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,380
the battery is big enough to provide the

157
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,320
voltage, yes in the sportiest mode this

158
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,760
car also when you floor it gets that

159
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,240
initial hit from the electricity and then

160
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,500
follows with the surge of the rest of the

161
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,540
power from the gas engine. Oh and 1 of

162
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,280
the things I say a lot on the autofocus

163
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,040
channel, or I've said before, is there

164
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,160
are certain types of cars that are best

165
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,280
to go electric and because of how much

166
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,420
batteries weigh, cars that are already

167
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,380
heavy are the best ones to go electric.

168
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,480
So like this is a big four-door luxury

169
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,000
sedan. There is no attempt at making this

170
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,260
a small car. It's huge, it's got lots of

171
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,360
space, it's soft, it's cushy. This is a

172
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,580
great type of car to go electric which is

173
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,480
why the i7 is good. But yeah, there are

174
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,420
lots of other versions of this. The RAV4

175
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,200
hybrid, the Toyota Prius Prime hybrid,

176
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,340
all sorts of other plug-in hybrids. Yeah,

177
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,480
if I were to recommend 1 version for more

178
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,640
people like this, you still get all the

179
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,180
nice plushy suspension and all the tech

180
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,820
in the car and all the screens and the

181
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,980
way it drives. It's the same thing, but

182
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,440
more accessible. You don't have to have a

183
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,140
plug in your garage. So all that is fun.

184
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,540
That's... I get it. It's versatile. This

185
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,000
is why they call it the ultimate driving

186
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,300
machine. But you can always spend more.

187
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,540
You can always spend more. And when you

188
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,320
do, you end up in the territory of

189
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,480
specialists. And this is definitely a

190
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:05,680
specialist. Just give me a second. 1

191
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,180
second, just want to... Okay. Now close

192
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:11,680
that.

193
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:25,940
I've just got eyes for you. No other

194
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:30,260
could enchant me, darling, like you do.

195
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,740
I've just got eyes for you.

196
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,740
So this car costs 2 and a half million

197
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:48,160
dollars And it's a hybrid purely for

198
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,020
performance, which I mean, you could

199
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,120
probably tell just by looking at it, but

200
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,940
also by the fact that I'm sitting in the

201
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,140
middle of the car right now. I have to

202
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,340
get used to this. This is the McLaren

203
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,640
Speedtail, okay? So McLaren's done this a

204
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,340
few times. 1 center driver's seat, 2

205
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,520
passenger seats, and just a whole lot of

206
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,560
calibration for me for this insane

207
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,500
driving position. But yeah, this thing is

208
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,160
a hybrid. It's technically a hybrid. So

209
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,060
this hybrid system is pretty crazy. It's

210
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,480
very focused on literally just going as

211
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,360
fast as physically possible, which is

212
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,080
just about maximizing power and

213
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,620
minimizing weight. So there's already a

214
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,460
twin turbo 4 liter V8 engine pushing out

215
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:33,000
750 plus horsepower, but then they've

216
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,300
also designed a special small but super

217
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,260
high powered 1.6 kilowatt hour battery

218
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,520
that powers a single electric motor by

219
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,860
itself that generates an extra 300 more

220
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,120
horsepower. So the total is now over a

221
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,400
thousand horsepower and that motor is

222
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,060
basically just being used to help spin

223
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,760
the wheels Even faster than the engine by

224
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,720
itself could there is no electric only

225
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,900
mode There is no situation where the gas

226
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,580
engine ever shuts off. There are no

227
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,720
efficiency goals here This is actually

228
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,700
really similar to the turbocharged hybrid

229
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,560
setups. You literally see in Formula 1

230
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,360
today It's just about going fast. So

231
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,900
here's a couple of those hilariously

232
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,720
over-engineered pieces of this car. First

233
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,580
of all, this is the only car I've ever

234
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,140
actually driven that's shipped with

235
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,720
cameras instead of side-view mirrors for

236
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,460
even better aerodynamics, of course

237
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,300
They've also got the electrochromic glass

238
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,600
roof tint and windshield tint instead of

239
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,520
moving fabric pieces. But then also the

240
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,540
active arrow on the back of this car is

241
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,760
not just like regular pivoting parts or

242
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,540
spoilers or anything like that. But it's

243
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,000
literally bending the carbon fiber

244
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,860
bodywork and all of the paint and

245
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,320
coatings with it up and down when you're

246
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,520
under braking to assist with slowing

247
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,440
down. It's that's insane if you can see

248
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,720
what's happening here. And this is also

249
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,360
the only car I've ever seen with a

250
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,960
wireless charger. That's right. The

251
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,200
McLaren Speedtail wireless charges So the

252
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,000
battery is at the bottom of the car and

253
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,760
it's small enough that if the driver

254
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,260
doesn't park Exactly over the right spot

255
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,160
in their garage. It's not a huge deal

256
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,680
because again, it's a small battery it

257
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,120
shouldn't take too long and inductive

258
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,620
charging has never been particularly

259
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,820
efficient but it'll eventually work and

260
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,700
no I don't think that this would fly for

261
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,080
any fully electric car today. Everything

262
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,880
about the outside of this car is designed

263
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,540
it's sculpted to just cut through the air

264
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,200
And that's how it does 0 to 186 miles an

265
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,320
hour faster than a Bugatti Chiron and 250

266
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,720
miles an hour in a straight line. Now I'm

267
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,120
going to let you in on a little secret

268
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,040
about these super, super fast electric

269
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,260
cars. They need a huge battery to

270
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,100
realistically make that happen, Right?

271
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,840
Let's take Tesla Model S Plaid for

272
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,660
example. A thousand horsepower, crazy

273
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,520
high power output from the battery. But

274
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,100
in order to do that they need to give it

275
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,100
this huge 100 kilowatt hour battery so

276
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,080
that when you export all that power You

277
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,440
don't just drain the battery super

278
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,240
quickly. You can keep driving like a

279
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,280
normal person. So that's why you have

280
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,740
these super high horsepower electric

281
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,940
cars, but they always come with the

282
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,920
sacrifice of weight. They're always

283
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,440
heavy. The Lucid Air, it's fighting its

284
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,960
weight. The EV6 GT, It's fighting how

285
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,620
heavy it is. With a supercar like this,

286
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,800
it's not fully electric all the time, and

287
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,740
so they're willing to put in a tiny

288
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,540
battery that exports a ton of power and

289
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:16,220
basically drains it in seconds. So I'm

290
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,720
going to show you something with this

291
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,140
real quick. Right now I have 100% of my

292
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,440
battery. I'm going to do just a quick

293
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,040
little pull and see just what a couple of

294
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,940
seconds of electric assisted acceleration

295
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:40,900
will do. All The way down to 74% battery,

296
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,320
just from that little acceleration, 100

297
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,000
to 74. And now it's already, it's going

298
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,800
right back up to 100. It's almost 100

299
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,040
again because I'm driving and

300
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,660
recuperating that energy and Now it's a

301
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,880
hundred This is super high-tech stuff and

302
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,320
it actually has a lot of parallels to

303
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,600
what we see in Formula 1 Believe it or

304
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,360
not those Formula 1 cars that we're

305
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,360
watching on TV today. Those are small

306
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,100
turbocharged Hybrid powertrains, I kind

307
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:21,300
of want to do that again That's what the

308
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,400
F1 cars are doing out there. They are

309
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,240
recovering energy as they brake, and they

310
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,520
are spending energy when they accelerate.

311
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,060
And I guess that's the difference between

312
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,220
this and the Rimac Nivera. You remember,

313
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,000
you probably have seen the video I did

314
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,580
with the quickest electric car in the

315
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,960
world, the Rimac Nivera, which yes does

316
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,760
have a big heavy battery. It weighs like

317
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,260
5,000 pounds, like a Model S. The crazy

318
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,540
thing about that car, and that's an

319
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,200
anomaly, is that it has 4 electric

320
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,220
motors, which you can kind of think of as

321
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,260
being treated like gears, but not really.

322
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,540
This will have a higher top speed simply

323
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,460
because it just keeps gearing up. 7-speed

324
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,480
gearbox and it pulls all the way through

325
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,320
up to 250 miles an hour. If you want a

326
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,800
hybrid supercar you can kind of have both

327
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,380
fast and quick in the same car. This is

328
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,280
fast and quick. I mean it's not

329
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,780
razor-sharp fully electric quick but it's

330
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,080
close and it's yeah it's the fastest It's

331
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,800
1 of the fastest cars you can possibly

332
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,440
build. Yeah, so I guess my point here

333
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,960
with the whole video is yes, I still

334
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,560
fully believe electrification is the

335
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,820
future at every level of cars But in the

336
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,760
meantime, it's pretty clear that hybrids

337
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,560
make a lot of sense. I mean, right under

338
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,340
our noses the whole time. That's about

339
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,180
it. I got to drive a speed deal.
